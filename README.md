# Static StoryMaps

A small (experimental) library for self-hosting a StoryMaps instance in GitHub, mostly for archival purposes.

## How to Use

* Make sure you've signed up for Github Pages
* Put your storymaps URL in the config

## Disclaimer


This relies on code from the KnightLab's StoryMaps library and uses a stable (0.7.6) version of the library's code. Some modifications have been made to the source Javascript to add CSS custom properties.
